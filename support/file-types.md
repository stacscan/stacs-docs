## File Types
<br />
This section of the documentation details which file types are supported by STACS.

### Plain-Text

All plain-text file formats are supported, regardless of their filename.

### Archives

As STACS works on detected file types, rather than the filename, file formats based on
these supported types are automatically supported, including Docker images, Android
APKs, OVAs, JARs, WARs, EARs, and more!

* ZIP (`zip`)
* 7-Zip (`7z`)
* bzip2 (`bz2`)
* gzip (`gz`)
* ISO (`iso`)
* XZ (`xz`)
* Tarball (`tar`)
* RPM (`rpm`)
